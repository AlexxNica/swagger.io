# Great News to the Swagger Community!

**Starting January 1st 2016 the Swagger Specification has been donated to the [Open API Initiative (OAI)](https://openapis.org) and is the foundation of the [OpenAPI Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).**

# A Powerful Interface to your API

Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API. With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment. With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability.

We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs. Swagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs.

Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.
